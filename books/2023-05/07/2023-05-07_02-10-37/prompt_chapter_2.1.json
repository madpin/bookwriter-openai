It also covers the different types of machine learning algorithms and their use cases.)\n1: What is Machine Learning?\n2: Types of Machine Learning\n2: Python for Machine Learning (This chapter covers the basics of Python programming and its use in machine learning. It also introduces the popular Python libraries used in machine learning.)\n1: Python Basics\n2: Python Libraries for Machine Learning\n3: Data Preprocessing (This chapter covers the different techniques used to preprocess data for machine learning. It also covers data cleaning, feature scaling, and feature selection.)\n1: Data Cleaning\n2: Feature Scaling\n3: Feature Selection\n4: Supervised Learning (This chapter covers the different supervised learning algorithms, including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.)\n1: Linear Regression\n2: Logistic Regression\n3: Decision Trees\n4: Random Forests\n5: Unsupervised Learning (This chapter covers the different unsupervised learning algorithms, including k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis.)\n1: K-Means Clustering\n2: Hierarchical Clustering\n3: Principal Component Analysis\n6: Deep Learning (This chapter covers the basics of deep learning and its use in building neural networks. It also covers popular deep learning frameworks, including TensorFlow and Keras.)\n1: Introduction to Deep Learning\n2: TensorFlow\n3: Keras\n7: Reinforcement Learning (This chapter covers the basics of reinforcement learning and its use in building intelligent systems. It also covers popular reinforcement learning algorithms, including Q-learning and SARSA.)\n1: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning\n2: Q-Learning\n3: SARSA\n\n\nI want you to write the subchapter 2.1: Data Preprocessing (In this subchapter, readers will learn how to clean and preprocess the data. They will learn techniques to handle missing values and format the data into a readable form.)The output should be a markdown file with aproximately 25 pages."
